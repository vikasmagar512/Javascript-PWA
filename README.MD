# A simple example PWA
Live at [https://js-pwa.firebaseapp.com/]

This project was built as part of a YouTube video on [https://youtube.com/c/academind](https://youtube.com/c/academind).

# Usage
Run `npm install` (you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for that) to install the development server which will serve the `public` folder.

Once that command finished, start the server via `npm start` and view the app at [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
